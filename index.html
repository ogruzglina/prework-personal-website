            <p> Hi, I'm Olga or Olya, I was born and raised in Ukraine where I'm also graduated with a degree in computer programming in 2012. 
                However I've never worked as a programmer, "thanks" to some of my teachers and friends who destroyed my self-esteem, confidence and etc, so I was afraid even to try. 
                Even though I decided to stay in IT, because it's an intresting field, and became a Quality Assurance Engeneer. 
                <br><br>
                After immigrating to America in October 2019 I realized that I wanted to pursue a career as a computer programmer. However, since I obtained my degree in another 
                country and did not use many of those skills in my job in QA, feel as though I am coming into the tech field as a new student. I feel that the tech 
                world changes very quickly, and I missed many years of knowledge and changes in this world. It is with this in mind that I am taking this next step in attending for Flatiron bootcamp!
